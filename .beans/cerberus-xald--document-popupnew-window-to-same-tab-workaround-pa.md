Workaround scope: users can often force popup flows into current tab by intercepting window.open or removing target=_blank.

## Scope
- Document canonical workaround snippets
- Add examples for OAuth-ish redirect/result flows
- Clarify when workaround is acceptable vs brittle

Research note: check Capybara/Cuprite behavior first; if unclear, fallback to Playwright JS/docs for confirmation.
