Feature-gap follow-up: role locator mapping currently supports only a narrow subset.

## Scope
- Prioritize additional ARIA roles with practical test value
- Define normalization rules and error behavior
- Add cross-driver tests for new role coverage

## Acceptance
- role(...) and ~lrole:namer support expanded, documented set
