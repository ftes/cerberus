Support count/position matching constraints (count/min/max/between, first/last/nth/indexed selection) in locator APIs and driver implementations with parity tests.

## Prerequisite
- Complete cerberus-1xnx rich locator oracle corpus updates first; preserve and extend that corpus as this bean lands.
