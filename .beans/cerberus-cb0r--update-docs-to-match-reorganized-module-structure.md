Phase 5: Documentation and architecture alignment.

Goals:
- Reflect driver-first organization and test strategy after refactor.
- Keep naming guidance aligned with HTML spec, Phoenix, PhoenixTest, Playwright, and Capybara references.

## Todo
- [ ] Update README and docs/architecture module references
- [ ] Document driver-loop test pattern replacing harness usage
- [ ] Document integration test placement in test/cerberus with CerberusTest.*
- [ ] Run format and precommit
