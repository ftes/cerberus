Finding follow-up: Firefox support status is inconsistent across docs and CI behavior.

## Scope
- Reconcile wording for current status (experimental vs tiered support)
- Align setup requirements with actual CI/runtime behavior
- Add explicit date-stamped status note if needed

## Acceptance
- Docs and CI expectations are consistent

## Summary of Changes

- Reconciled README and browser support policy wording for browser support status.
- Added explicit browser support policy review date: February 28, 2026.
- Clarified CI behavior: chrome baseline lane with targeted firefox-tagged conformance coverage.
- Updated README browser setup wording to match this policy language.
