Finding follow-up: Firefox support status is inconsistent across docs and CI behavior.

## Scope
- Reconcile wording for current status (experimental vs tiered support)
- Align setup requirements with actual CI/runtime behavior
- Add explicit date-stamped status note if needed

## Acceptance
- Docs and CI expectations are consistent
