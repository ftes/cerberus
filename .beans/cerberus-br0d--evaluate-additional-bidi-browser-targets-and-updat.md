Evaluate realistic additional browser targets for Cerberus WebDriver BiDi support (beyond Chrome and Firefox), with a recommendation and explicit tiering updates in docs/browser-support-policy.md based on current protocol/runtime maturity.

## Summary of Changes

- Reviewed current non-Chrome browser maturity for Cerberus WebDriver BiDi targeting using primary sources.
- Updated browser support policy with an explicit additional-browser evaluation section (dated February 28, 2026).
- Added recommendation to prioritize Edge as the next Tier 2 target after CI stabilization.
- Confirmed Safari/WebKit remains Tier 3 pending stable release-channel BiDi maturity.
- Added direct source links in policy docs for decision traceability.
