Finding follow-up: contributor/internal migration verification docs are currently included in published ExDoc extras.

## Scope
- Keep maintainer docs in repo
- Exclude internal workflow docs from public end-user docs nav
- Ensure docs set focuses on user-relevant API behavior

## Acceptance
- ExDoc guides no longer include internal migration verification workflow pages
