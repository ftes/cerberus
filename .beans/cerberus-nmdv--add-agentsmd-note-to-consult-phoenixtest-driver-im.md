## Scope
Add a guidance note in AGENTS.md: when uncertain about static/live driver behavior, check PhoenixTest driver implementations for reference patterns.

## Done When
- [x] AGENTS.md includes the guidance note.
- [x] Bean is completed with summary.

## Summary of Changes

- Added an AGENTS.md guideline to consult PhoenixTest static/live driver implementations when uncertain about behavior details.
- Kept the note close to browser/runtime policy guidance so driver implementation references are easy to find during future work.
