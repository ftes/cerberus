Add stateful locator constraints (checked/unchecked, disabled/enabled, selected, readonly/editable, visible/hidden) across Static, Live, and Browser implementations with conformance tests.

## Prerequisite
- Complete cerberus-1xnx rich locator oracle corpus updates first; preserve and extend that corpus as this bean lands.
