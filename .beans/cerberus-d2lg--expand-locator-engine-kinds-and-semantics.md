Implement a fuller locator engine beyond the current slice: first-class role/label/placeholder/alt text/title/testid lookup semantics across Static, Live, and Browser drivers (with browser-oracle parity coverage).

## Prerequisite
- Complete cerberus-1xnx rich locator oracle corpus updates first; preserve and extend that corpus as this bean lands.
