## Scope
Add concise project-level working guidelines to `AGENTS.md`.

## Required Guidance
- keep implementation simple
- browser-oracle harness focus for HTML behavior/spec parity
- update docs when behavior/architecture changes
- commit in small increments; run `mix precommit` before each commit

## Done When
- [x] AGENTS.md updated with the four guidance points.
- [x] Existing Beans priming instruction remains intact.

## Summary of Changes
- Updated `AGENTS.md` with a new **General Guidelines** section.
- Added guidance for simplicity, browser-oracle harness emphasis, doc updates, and commit discipline (`mix precommit` before commit).
- Preserved the Beans priming instruction at the top unchanged.
