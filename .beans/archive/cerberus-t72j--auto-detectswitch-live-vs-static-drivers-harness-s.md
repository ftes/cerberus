## Goal
Define implementation strategy for auto-detection/switching between static and live drivers and harness view architecture.

## Todo
- [ ] Inspect current driver dispatch and harness/view setup
- [ ] Propose architecture for shared static baseline + live extensions
- [ ] Identify test placement inside and outside harness
- [ ] Summarize recommended rollout plan

## Reasons for Scrapping

Duplicate of existing task `cerberus-5b0k` (same scope: static/live auto-detection and harness strategy). Consolidating work in the original bean to avoid split tracking.
