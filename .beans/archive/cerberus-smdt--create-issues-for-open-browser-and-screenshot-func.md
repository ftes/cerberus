User requested new issues for dev/debug functions.

## Todo
- [x] Create issue for open_browser across all drivers
- [x] Create issue for screenshot as browser-only API
- [x] Link issues to appropriate parent beans
- [x] Add summary of changes

## Summary of Changes
- Created cerberus-bfji: Add open_browser debug function across static, live, and browser drivers.
- Created cerberus-bwtm: Add browser-only screenshot debug function parity.
- Linked both issues under cerberus-zqpu (Public API parity roadmap).
- Added blocking relationship so cerberus-bwtm blocks cerberus-rxqy (Browser-only extensions parity slice).
