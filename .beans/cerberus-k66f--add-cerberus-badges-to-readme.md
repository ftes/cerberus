Add Hex version, docs, license, and GitHub Actions badges to README using cerberus naming/URLs.

## Summary of Changes
Added a README badge block under the title with Cerberus-specific links for Hex version, Hex docs, license, and GitHub Actions status.
Used repository-correct file paths for the license and workflow badge (`LICENSE`, `ci.yml`).
