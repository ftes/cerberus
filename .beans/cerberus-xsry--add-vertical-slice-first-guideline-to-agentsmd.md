## Scope
Extend AGENTS.md guidance to explicitly require vertical-slice delivery.

## Done When
- [x] AGENTS.md includes explicit rule: always deliver vertical slices end-to-end.
- [x] Existing guideline section remains coherent.

## Summary of Changes
- Updated `AGENTS.md` general guidelines with an explicit vertical-slice-first rule.
- Rule states that slices should be delivered end-to-end, including API, drivers, and harness coverage for that slice.
